Recently, I've stood up our Mastodon instance: See [Join our Mastodon]({% post_url /2021/2021-02-12-join-our-mastodon %}) for more details.

I'm quickly coming to the realization that if I want this site to be family friendly, I going to need to need help moderating it. If you like what I'm trying to do with it, have the desire to scan the federated timeline throughout the day, and handle the occasional report from users, [please get in touch with me](https://thewismit.com/contact).

The server is still very small. In fact it's only myself and a few family members at this time. But I do hope it grows as time goes on and I'd love to have moderators for when that happens!
